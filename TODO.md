1. Customizable log templates
The current implementation always inserts logs using the template console.<level>({ <word> }); as seen in lua/logdebug/init.lua lines 24‑30. Allow users to specify a custom template (for example, console.<level>("<word>:", <word>);) or supply a function that formats the log statement. This would let developers tailor the output to their preferred style.

2. Support for selections, not just words
Both the README and help file mention inserting logs for “the word under the cursor” (README lines 1‑4 and 6‑7). Adding a command to log the current visual selection or a provided text object would make the plugin more flexible when variables span multiple words or include expressions.

3. Language‑specific comment styles
comment_all_logs() prepends // to log lines (lines 54‑62 of the Lua code). This works for JavaScript/TypeScript but fails for languages with different comment syntax. Detecting commentstring from the buffer’s filetype or exposing it as an option would allow the plugin to comment logs correctly in any language.

4. Configurable log level rotation
The plugin currently cycles through “log”, “info”, “warn” and “error” (code lines 3‑4 and 66‑70). Providing a configuration setting to specify the order or include additional levels (e.g. “debug” or “trace”) would offer more flexibility.

5. Highlight or navigate inserted logs
Adding an option to highlight inserted log lines or populate the quickfix list with them would help developers track and remove logs before committing code. Since remove_all_logs() already walks the buffer line by line (lines 44‑52), a similar mechanism could gather log locations or add signs for easier navigation.

These suggestions focus on extending the existing capabilities described in the documentation—insert/remove logs, comment them out, and toggle verbosity—to make the plugin more adaptable to different workflows and languages.
